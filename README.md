# Avoid Asteroid

The inital version of this simple game was for an Assignment. However, I decided to enhance it more as I go and turn it into a real game from my childhood which was basically space - shooter. 
Feel free to fork it if you'd like and develop it more.

@ Changes 
  --Added background
  --Loop throughout the run for blinking stars
  --Added stars. For now, of type Asteroid
  --Updated the Asteroid Color
